# Dynamic Heuristic Growth (DHG) for EQL

 A PyTorch implementation of Dynamic Heuristic Growth for Equation Learners. [Jiménez-García, Jorge (2025). Adaptive Depth Scaling for Interpretable Equation Learning](https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/225633)

 DHG applies Adaptive train-time depth scaling by informing heuristics with gradient updates, additionally implementing Skip/Concat connections to the network. The technique combined is shown to outperform the inclusion of Skip/Concat connections, and the application of DHG in isolation, respectively.
